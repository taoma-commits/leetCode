### twoSum (easy)

- python dictionary: distinct keys
- hash-based search: trade off space for speed
  * time complexity: near O(1) unless collision
  * space complexity: O(n)
  * warning:
  ```
  key in dictionary.keys()
  ```
  has time complexity O(n) because ```dictionary.keys()``` is a list.
- one-pass hash table
